## Introduction

This repository provides practical examples and exercises to help you understand and implement machine learning algorithms using Python. The content is organized to follow the chapters of the book, making it easy to find and work through the examples as you read.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GurjotSinghAulakh/Machine-Learning-with-Python-A-Practical-Introduction.git
cd Machine-Learning-with-Python-A-Practical-Introduction
```

I recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create and activate a virtual environment as follows:
python3 -m venv venv
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

## Usage

You can find Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts corresponding to each chapter in the notebooks and scripts directories, respectively.

To start a Jupyter notebook server, run:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then, navigate to the notebooks directory and open the notebook you want to work on.
